# projects-basket
Hello! My name is Alex, and I am interested in physics and software development. I have recently completed a B.S. in physics, I am now looking forward to creating good programming habits to write efficient and easy to read code.
I have created this repository to keep a collection of personal projects that I find exciting, and projects that help me build a foundation for writing good code.
To reach me, I welcome any emails to alex1balik@gmail.com. Thank you for reading!
Personal projects.
