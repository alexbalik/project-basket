# projects-basket
Hello! My name is Alex, and I am interested in physics, scientific research, software development, and data science. I have created this repository to keep a collection of personal projects that I find exciting, and projects that help me build a foundation for writing good code. Please note that I created this repository before having working knowledge of Git and using the Linux terminal to push projects to GitHub. More recent projects have their own repositories and are maintained using Git. 

In terms of my resume, I have 1.5 years of operations engineering experience where I worked on my own research project and a BS in physics where I performed research on minimal surfaces in the context of general relativity. I am now looking forward to creating good programming habits to write efficient and easy to read code.

To reach me, I welcome any emails to alex1balik@gmail.com. Thank you for reading!
