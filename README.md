# projects-basket
Hello! My name is Alex, and I am interested in physics, scientific research, software development, and data science. I have 1.5 years of operations engineering experience where I worked on my own research project and a BS in physics where I performed research on minimal surfaces in the context of general relativity. I am now looking forward to creating good programming habits to write efficient and easy to read code.
I have created this repository to keep a collection of personal projects that I find exciting, and projects that help me build a foundation for writing good code.
To reach me, I welcome any emails to alex1balik@gmail.com. Thank you for reading!
